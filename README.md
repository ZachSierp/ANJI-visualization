# ANJI Visualization

## Using ANJI-Visualization
The visualization tool can be used directly from the command line. The program requires at least two inputs:
1. An ANJI output XML directory containing the data to be plotted
1. A config file of type .ini specifying different settings. (Examples are providied in the "Example_Config" folder as well as a template.)

To run the program (the order of the config file and directory to not matter):
'''
$python xparse.py your_config.ini your_directory
'''
